This is my second iteration in project2 for the course 'Web Programming With Python and Javascript'

In this iteration I'm being more lean and focusing on the objectives of the project.

Code is way simpler, and works better as well.

I've let oop aside and decided to use just lists and simple dictionaries to keep the information that's necessary serverside. 

I've replaced the complicated login system with a really simple one, wich is way more fun and inline with the spirit of the project. 

Also relied more on the client-side to retain information about the channel he's in and his current display name.

While checking out my project, you may wanna talk to the chatbot...


obs: Currently the flask-socketio library has a bug that doesn't allow the server to run properly when using 'flask run' command. So you may have to use 'python application.py' for the project to run smoothly.

In this project I've used the chatterbot(and chatterbot -corpus) libraries, wich are great for creating simple chatbots. They're open source =)
